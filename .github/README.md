# Settings application

The settings application for dahliaOS

## Application Requirements

In order to be compatible with the desktop and mobile pangolin window manager, all applications must be implemented as a flutter materialApp widget. 

This is so that when the app is opened through pangolin, the app is not loaded through the window manager process.
